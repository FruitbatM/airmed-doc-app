# Functionality Testing 

Comprehensive testing was executed. Further elaborated in more details below:


## Device Testing

- The website was physically tested on the following devices with different screen sizes:
  - iPhone 7 (Safari & Google Chrome)
  - iPhone 8 (Safari & Google Chrome)
  - iPhone 11 (Safari & Google Chrome)
  - Samsung GTI9505 Galaxy S4 (Chrome for Android)
  - Samsung Galaxy 9 (Chrome for Android & Samsung Internet)
  - Samsung Galaxy S20 (Chrome for Android & Samsung Internet)
  - Nokia Lumia 640 LTE (Windows 10) (Microsoft Edge)
  - HUAWEI P30 lite (Chrome for Android)
  - Samsung Galaxy Tab A (Chrome for Android & Samsung Internet)
  - Lenovo ThinkBook 13S (Chrome, Microsoft Edge & Firefox)

The results were consistent, the website is platform-cross compatible and responsive. Furthermore, using DevTools I checked responsiveness for different screen sizes for mobile and tablet devices. Several issues were found and fixed all described under Encountered Issues section.

# Encountered Issues


# Web Accessibility

The website's homepage was tested to ensure it was accessible to people with disabilities using the [Web Accessibility](https://www.webaccessibility.com/) checker.

Overall, the home and about us pages received a very good score of 98 and 93% respectively.

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme/images/web_accessibility_score.jpg" alt="accessibility score" target="_blank" width="75%" height="75%"></h2>

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme/images/accessibility_about.jpg" alt="accessibility score" target="_blank" width="75%" height="75%"></h2>

# Performance Testing
Performance was tested using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) tool.

## Desktop

### Home page

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme/images/desktop_home.jpg" alt="lighthouse performance for home page" target="_blank" width="45%" height="45%"></h2>

### About Us page

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme/images/desktop_about.jpg" alt="lighthouse performance for about page" target="_blank" width="45%" height="45%"></h2>

For desktop performance, results were similar every time for both home and about pages.
The result is somewhat lover for 'Best Practices' due to Trust and Safety - the page 'Does not use HTTPS'. Since this is a project for educational purpose only it is not required to instal SSL certificate and therefore this warning can be ignored. 

The performance results are overall satisfying as the website is heavy loaded with the content.

## Mobile
### Home page

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme/images/mobile_home.jpg" alt="lighthouse performance for home page" target="_blank" width="45%" height="45%"></h2>

### About Us page

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme/images/mobile_about.jpg" alt="lighthouse performance for about page" target="_blank" width="45%" height="45%"></h2>

The mobile results were somewhat different every time. Following article [Why are my Lighthouse scores different from my other test results?](https://support.speedcurve.com/en/articles/4088236-why-are-my-lighthouse-scores-different-from-my-other-test-results#:~:text=The%20performance%20score%20is%20strongly,cause%20variability%20in%20your%20scores.) gives an explanation on Lighthouse that "the performance score is strongly influenced by Time to Interactive (TTI) and Total Blocking Time (TBT), which can be quite different depending on the test environment and runtime settings."

The performance results are overall satisfying as the website is heavy loaded with the content.
